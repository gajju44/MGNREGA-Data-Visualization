# MGNREGA-Data-Visualization
This is an assignment given as part of the Build for Bharat Fellowship - 2026 Cohort, where we have to create a website that utilizes the open API provided by the Government of India for the MGNREGA scheme. The goal is to present the data in a simple and accessible way so that even people with low technological literacy can easily understand it.
